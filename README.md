# Mobile Phone Scraper

This project is a web scraper that gathers data on mobile phone prices and brands from an online shop. The data is then written to a JSON file and displayed in a table on a React-based web app. The app allows users to filter and sort the data according to various criteria.

# Technologies Used
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests) for web scraping
* JSON file for data storage
+ React for web app development
    
# Scheduling the script
You can schedule the script to run on a daily basis using the built-in task scheduler in your operating system or using a library such as schedule in python.

# Note
1. Make sure that the script is able to access the website and scrape the data.
2. The script is currently set to scrape the data only for mobile phone prices and brand, 
   you can add or modify the script to scrape other data as well.
